> My Favorite place is **Disneyland** and is located in NewYork. It is the first of two theme parks built at the Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, California, opened on July 17, 1955. *It is the only theme park designed and built to completion under the direct supervision of Walt Disney.* It was originally the only attraction on the property; its official name was changed to Disneyland Park to distinguish it from the expanding complex in the 1990s. It was the first Disney theme park.
